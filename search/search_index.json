While the government and other NGOs work towards making sanitary products free and accessible to adolescent girls, there is no proper system in place to actualize this. What we hope to achieve with the Mi.Mi project, is to create convenient access to sanitary towels to girls living in low income areas in Kenya. Product Specifics Authors: Celine Gushima Wuanita Wanjiku Ayebaza Esther Brenda Gitau Victorine Amani Project name: Mimi Project Status: Under Development Problem: Mimi aims to make the distribution of sanitary towels by NGOs and the government more efficient to girls in informal settlements. Solution: Mimi is developing a pad dispenser for Ngo's where the registered student will be able to dispense the pads she needs at their convinient time,The machine will be managed by Mimi and refilled by the NGO. Background. With the population of adolescent girls being approximately 37% in only two slums of Nairobi, Kibera, and Mukuru, formative research shows that girls living in this area face monthly challenges when it comes to purchasing sanitary pads. 65% of the women and girls in Kenya are unable to afford sanitary pads, due to the high cost of disposable pads. To combat this period-poverty dilemma, approximately four million girls in public schools in Kenya receive sanitary products through the government\u2019s Sanitary Towels Programme, which was launched in 2011. We also have about 6.5 million girls benefiting from Non-Governmental Organizations that distribute free pads to its members and schools around the communities they serve. However, school closures mean that the majority of these girls are unable to access the free sanitary pads, making it difficult for them to manage their periods. There is also a challenge in how these pads are distributed as there have been cases where the pads distributed are way less than what the girls need (for example 4 packets a year) forcing these girls to look for other alternative ways. Prices of sanitary pads vary from cheaper brands (e.g., AllTyme and Sunny Girl) which cost approximately 50 shillings for a package of eight to P&G\u2019s Always which costs 80 shillings or more per package of eight. However, over 80% of women and girls cannot afford P&G\u2019s Always (80 KSH or more a package) monthly. It is therefore common for women and girls to use both sanitary pads and homemade alternatives to manage their periods. As a result of this, we aim to understand the behavioral impacts of the lack of sanitary towels among girls aged 13 to 17 in the informal settlement of Kenya. We also seek to get and understand what challenges they face that may cause these irregular distribution patterns. Objectives/Goals of the project Our main goal is to increase access to sanitary towels in low-income and rural areas of Kenya while allowing the Government and NGOs to remotely monitor and keep track of their donations. We also look forward to reducing the number of girls who end up staying at home because of period poverty. Why build pad dispenser? From the research we carried out, we were able to establish that there is no proper system in place for the girls to get access to sanitary towels, and the available accessibility options are not really comfortable for them. We also hope to reduce the number of stay at home adolescent girls because they can\u2019t afford sanitary towels. Through this dispenser we are looking towards making it easier for NGOs and the government to remotely monitor and keep track of their donations.
